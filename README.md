# 🐺 Fool's Mate API

An API to consume the official [Wolvesville API](https://api-docs.wolvesville.com/#/).

## ❓ Motivations

The Wolvesville API is (or was) missing some features I would like for my [front-end application](https://github.com/Fearinn/foolsMate), such as pagination and filtering. I also needed some experience with back-end and had to prevent secrets from leaking, so I decided to build this as an extra layer of logic on the official API.
